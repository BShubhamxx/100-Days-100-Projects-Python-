# 🐍 100 Days of Python Code

This repository contains my day-wise Python projects completed as part of the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**.  
Each project is implemented using my own logic and understanding, with consistent daily progress.

## 📅 Day-Wise Progress

### Day 1 – Tip Calculator
- Built a simple and basic **Tip Calculator**.
- Takes the total bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people as input.
- Calculates the final amount each person has to pay.
- Concepts used:
  - Variables
  - User input
  - Type conversion
  - Basic arithmetic operations

---

### Day 2 – Treasure Game
- Developed a simple **Treasure Game** using conditional statements.
- The game is based on user choices and decision-making.
- Concepts used:
  - `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
  - Nested conditions
  - Logical flow control

---

### Day 3 – Rock Paper Scissors Game
- Created a **Rock Paper Scissors** game using the `random` module.
- The user plays against the computer with randomly generated choices.
- Displays the game result based on standard rules.
- Concepts used:
  - `random` module
  - Lists
  - Conditional statements
  - Game logic

---

### Day 4 – Password Generator
- Built a **Password Generator** that creates strong and random passwords.
- Allows the user to choose the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
- Generates a shuffled password for better security.
- Concepts used:
  - `random` module
  - Lists
  - Loops
  - User input
  - String manipulation

### Day 5 – Reeborg’s World (Hurdles & Maze)
- On Day 5, I explored **Reeborg’s World**, an interactive platform designed to help beginners learn programming concepts using Python (JavaScript is also supported).
- The objective was to guide a robot named **Reeborg** to its destination by applying the programming concepts learned so far.
- Using the game’s built-in functions along with logical thinking, Reeborg successfully completed multiple challenges.

🔗 **Reeborg’s World:** https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html 

- These challenges were simple yet tricky, requiring proper use of loops, conditions, and functions.
- This day focused heavily on logic building and problem-solving rather than syntax alone.

#### 📥 Importing the Solution:
- Solutions can be imported by navigating to **“Additional Options”** in Reeborg’s World and using the **import** feature.

#### Concepts used:
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Logical reasoning

### Day 6 – Hangman Game
- Built a classic **Hangman** game using Python.
- A random word is selected, and the player has 6 lives to guess the correct letters.
- Incorrect guesses reduce lives, while correct guesses reveal the hidden word.
- ASCII art is used to visually display the hangman stages.

#### Concepts used:
- Python modules and imports
- Loops and conditional statements
- Lists and strings
- Game logic and user input

---

### Day 7 – Caesar Cipher Program
- Built a **Caesar Cipher** program that can encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift-based encryption technique.
- Each letter in the message is shifted by a user-defined number while keeping numbers, symbols, and spaces unchanged.

#### 🔐 Features:
- Encode and decode text
- Safely handles non-alphabet characters
- Circular shifting using modular arithmetic

#### Concepts used:
- Functions
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements
- Lists
- String manipulation

---

### Day 8 – Silent Auction (Bidding Program)
- Built a **Silent Auction** program in Python where multiple users can place bids secretly.
- Each bidder enters their name and bid amount, which are stored until the bidding ends.
- Once bidding is complete, the program determines and displays the highest bidder and the winning amount.
- Screen clearing is simulated to maintain bid privacy.

#### 🧠 Concepts used:
- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements
- Basic algorithm for finding the maximum value

---

### Day 9 – Calculator Program
- Built a simple **Calculator** program in Python to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using functions stored in a dictionary.
- Allows users to continue calculations with the previous result or start a new calculation without restarting the program.
- Displays an ASCII logo at the start for a better user experience.

#### 🧠 Concepts used:
- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Recursion

---

## 🚀 Goal
- Complete all 100 days with daily commits.
- Strengthen Python fundamentals.
- Improve problem-solving skills through hands-on projects.

## 📌 Note
More projects will be added as I continue progressing through the challenge.
