Day 6 – Final Project: Hangman Game

The Day 6 final project, Hangman, is divided into 6 step-by-step stages, where each step gradually builds toward the complete game. This structured approach makes the logic easier to understand and implement.

In the final stage, the project uses separate files for better organization by importing:
-A set of words for random selection
-Game logos and hangman stage visuals

This modular structure helps improve code readability and maintainability.
