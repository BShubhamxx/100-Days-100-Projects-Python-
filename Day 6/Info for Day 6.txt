### Day 6 – Final Project: Hangman Game
- The Day 6 final project, **Hangman**, is developed in **6 step-by-step stages**, where each stage gradually builds toward the complete game.
- This structured approach makes the logic easier to understand and implement.
- In the final stage, the project is organized using separate Python files for better modularity.

- The game imports:
  - A list of words for random selection
  - Game logo and hangman stage visuals (ASCII art)

- This modular structure improves code readability and maintainability.

#### 📂 Project Structure:
- `Hangman_Step_5.py` – Main game logic  
- `hangman_words.py` – Word list for the game  
- `hangman_art.py` – Game logo and hangman stages
