Day 5 – Reeborg’s World (Hurdles & Maze)

On Day 5, we explored Reeborg’s World, an interactive platform designed to help beginners learn programming using Python (JavaScript is also supported).

The challenge was to guide a robot named Reeborg to the goal using the concepts learned so far. By combining the game’s built-in functions with logical thinking, we successfully helped Reeborg complete the Hurdle Race and reach the destination. Simple, yet tricky!

This day includes solutions for:

Hurdle 1, Hurdle 2, Hurdle 3, Hurdle 4
&
Final Challenge – Escaping the Maze

To use these solutions, open “Additional Options” in Reeborg’s World and import the code.

This day mainly focuses on logic building, loops, and conditional thinking.
