Like Day 6 day 7 is also divided in parts for better understanding.
Day 7:
Caesar Cipher - for encoding and decoding text.

What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a simple, ancient substitution cipher where each letter in a message is 
shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet (e.g., A becomes D with a shift of 3). 
Named after Julius Caesar, it's a basic form of encryption, easily cracked by modern standards

Day & wraps with building a Caesar Cipher program for encoding and decoding text.

SEEE YAAA!!! TO NEXT DAY!
